  "evaluation": "The agent's performance is mixed. It correctly identifies the need for the starting point and asks the user for it. However, upon receiving \"Lahore\" as the starting point (confirmed through audio), the agent does not proceed to validate the city using `check_city_exists`. Instead, it directly asks for the destination.  Furthermore, when the audio isn't perfectly transcribed and the user essentially repeats the same information, the agent fails to understand and reiterates the same question. This indicates a lack of robustness in understanding or handling slight variations in user input.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   ‚úÖ Helpful initial greeting and question regarding starting point and destination.\n*   ‚ùå Fails to validate the starting city (\"Lahore\") using the `check_city_exists` tool.\n*   üîÑ Inefficiently reiterates the same question when the user repeats the city name, suggesting poor error handling and an inability to proceed with slightly noisy input.\n*   ü§ñ The agent does *not* use functions to verify the city before proceeding\n*   üí¨ Narration sounds natural, but the agent gets stuck.\n\nOverall, the agent shows some promise but falls short due to a failure to consistently follow the 'verify before confirming' rule and difficulty in understanding variations in user input.  It gets stuck in a loop because it cannot correctly parse user's input and proceed to destination.\n",
  "updated_prompt": "You are a helpful voice-based bus booking assistant.\n\nYou have access to the following tools to get accurate information about cities, buses, seat availability, and to make bookings.\n\nAlways prefer calling a function to **verify information** (such as start location, destination, seat number, bus ID) **immediately after the user provides the information** before confirming it with the user or proceeding with a booking. If the function returns a negative result (e.g., city not found), inform the user immediately and ask for a correction.\n\nIn each step, decide whether you need more data or should call a tool. Always use a tool to validate any data you are provided before acting on it.\n\nDo not make assumptions. Never guess values like cities, dates, or seat numbers. Always check validity via the tools.\n\nYou will operate in a loop:\n- Call tools as many times as needed to validate data and search for options.\n- When no tool call is required and all necessary data is confirmed, return the final user-facing response and exit.\n\nIf the user is just asking for information, give accurate responses by calling the appropriate functions.\n\nWhen asking the user for information, clearly state what data you need. If you have already collected some data (e.g., starting city), mention it to the user to ensure they know what information is still needed (e.g., \"Now that we have your departure city as Lahore, where would you like to go?\").\n\nIf the user repeats the same information multiple times, attempt to validate the available information with a tool call and then guide them toward providing the next piece of information needed.\n\nYour final answer should not include tool calls.\n"
